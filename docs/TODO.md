### TODO.md

- web interface stuff
  - is started, needs more work
  - websockets
    - copy over ff websocket implementation
    - ** get it working on ws:// not wss:// b/c local app/certs stuff ??
    - this means no mixed stuff? meaning - we can't have *any* remote resources hosted on https!!
      - only ways around are:
        - create a self-signed certificate, user must accept warning - bad
        - create a self-signed certificate and ask user to install to local cert store - not great, but most "proper"
        - make a subdomain point to 127.0.0.1 and get a real cert - seems very bad
        	- man in the middle possible with remote dns though unlikely
        	- subdomain has to resolve locally - requires net or entry in hosts
        	- worse, we have to distribute the private key which opens up other attacks
        - or, don't use a local cert and don't have any remote https resources?
  - JS compilation stuff
    - js variable replacing maybe? or ejs templates?
    - react/jsx is good.
  - ** cache google fonts; we can't load them remotely over https without a cert/being on https ourselves
    - easy way is to just wget and statically link
    - might be nice to have something that can pull them from a file but eh
- other gpu stuff
  - nvml/libdrm stuff, default driver info?
  - root not needed/(wanted?) for nv-settings? bleh
    - this prevents doing something like 'gpumgr.js fan enable all' with both vendors
    - we could use sudo for amd stuff but then we have to exec all our ioctl writes instead of fileWrite()
      - non-interactive (web interface) still has a problem unless sudo is pre-configured
    - we could use setuid
      - requires script to have setuid permissions?
      - can we setuid like sudo? doesn't seem like it
      - we could sudo ourself.
  - pursue intelk
- add ability to change clocks and other features
  - is there *any* way to change NVIDIA clocks without X?
  - I haven't seen anything really, although the amdpwrman reddit thread had some links to other programs doing good things
  - can we set custom amd clock easily, rather than selecting profiles?
- should we have any amdgpu flashing features? (super low priority)
  - could potentially make custom amd BIOSes for flashing? (super low priority)
