### TODO.md

- finish implementing all amdgpu features from amdpwrman
- implement as much original^ functionality as possible for nvidia
- ^ same for intel
- start on web interface stuff
- add ability to change clocks and other features
- is there *any* way to change NVIDIA clocks without X?
  - I haven't seen anything really, although the amdpwrman reddit thread had some links to other programs doing good things
- can we set custom amd clock easily, rather than selecting profiles?
  - should we have any amdgpu flashing features? (low priority)
  - could potentially make custom BIOS on the fly? (low priority)
