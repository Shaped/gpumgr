### TODO.md

- web interface stuff
  - is started, needs more work
  - websockets
    - copy over ff websocket implementation
    - ** get it working on ws:// not wss:// b/c local app/certs stuff ??
    - this means no mixed stuff? meaning - we can't have *any* remote resources hosted on https!!
      - only ways around are:
        - create a self-signed certificate, user must accept warning - bad
        - create a self-signed certificate and ask user to install to local cert store - not great, but most "proper"
        - make a subdomain point to 127.0.0.1 and get a real cert - seems very bad
        	- man in the middle possible with remote dns though unlikely
        	- subdomain has to resolve locally - requires net or entry in hosts
        	- worse, we have to distribute the private key which opens up other attacks
        - or, don't use a local cert and don't have any remote https resources?
  - jsx compilation & caching
    - get babel working for react/jsx
    - js variable replacing/ejs templates?
  - ** cache google fonts; we can't load them remotely over https without a cert/being on https ourselves
- add ability to change clocks and other features
  - is there *any* way to change NVIDIA clocks without X?
  - I haven't seen anything really, although the amdpwrman reddit thread had some links to other programs doing good things
  - can we set custom amd clock easily, rather than selecting profiles?
- should we have any amdgpu flashing features? (super low priority)
  - could potentially make custom amd BIOSes for flashing? (super low priority)
